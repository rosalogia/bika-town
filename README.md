# Bika Town

A little game for my friends and I, written in Rust, with way too much time spent on designing the programming interface.

Assets used are from [Snodekfeld's Fantasy RPG Pixel art Asset-Pack on itch.io](https://snodekfeld.itch.io/fantasy-rpg-pixel-art-asset-pack).
It rocks and you should buy it. If you would like to build the game and run it with the right assets:

1. Buy the assets.
2. Unzip them.
3. Copy the contents of the unzipped folder directly into the `Assets` folder in the project root.

## Objective

The goal on the horizon right now is to get a cozy 2D RPG with the following list of features:

- [ ] PvE Combat
  - [ ] Procedurally generated dungeons
  - [ ] Player classes
- [ ] Online multiplayer via TCP.
  - [ ] Trading
  - [ ] _Maybe_ PvP?
  - [ ] Party system
  - [ ] Chat
- [ ] Various thematic environments and levels, not sure whether we want plot or anything yet
- [ ] Life-skilling
  - [ ] Fishing
  - [ ] Farming
- [ ] NPC Interactions
  - [ ] Quests
  - [ ] Shops
